HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol

server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message

Pull protocol - clients always initiates the request from the server

“Polling” - process where the computer or controlling device waits for an external device to check for its readiness or state, often with low-level hardware

HTTP 2 – server can now send information to the client

	Stateless protocol – serve and forget protocol
