 <h3>Overview of the World Wide Web and Technology</h3>


World Wide Web
<ul>
<li>A global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a
synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, as e-mail does.
<li>In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support
from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were
willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web.
</ul>

Tim-Berners Lee
<ul>
<li>Father of the web
<li>In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN (European Organization of Nuclear Research), invented the World Wide Web or simply the Web. The web was originally conceived for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.

The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer. The website described the features of the Web; how to access other people’s documents and how to set up your own server.

The NeXt machine is the original web server.
<li>On 30 April 1993, CERN put the Web software in the public domain. CERN made the next release available with an open license, as a more sure way to maximize its dissemination.

The line-mode browser was launched in 1992, and was the first readily accessible browser for the Web

The three cornerstone of the web: HTTP, HTML, URI.

 <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http)</h3>



HTTP (hypermedia)
<ul>
<li>Application layer used primarily to retrieve hypertext (on hypermedia) documents and resources on the World Wide Web
<li>Jointly developed by the W3C and the IETF
<li>HTTP is based on client-server architecture
<li>HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as cache control, content media type (MIME) specification, language and character set
specification, content/transfer coding, client-server protocol negotiations, persistent connections, request pipelining, etc.
</ul>

Protocol
<ul>
<li>Set of rules need to be followed
</ul>

Fundamentals
<ul>
<li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
	<ul>
		<li>Invented by Tim Berners- Lee
		<li>jointly developed by W3c and the IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force)
		<li>HTTP 0.9(!991) Originally made by Tim Berners-Lee
			<ul>
				<li>one way to get a request by "Get" was developed on this era
			</ul>
		<li>HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1995) May 1996
		<li>HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068, RFC 2616) January 1997, June 1999
		<li>7230-7235(June 8 1999)
		<li>HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015)-->SPDY-->by Google-->backwards compatible

 <h3>Uniform Resource Locators (url)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. 
	<li>A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
	<li>Uniform Resource Locators were defined in RFC 1738 in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee and the URI working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

Syntax
	<li>The scheme, consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. It is followed by a colon (:). Examples of popular schemes include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.
	<li>Two slashes (//): This is required by some schemes and not required by some others. When the authority component (explained below) is absent, the path component cannot begin with two slashes.
	<li>An authority part, comprising:
		<ul>
			<li>An optional authentication section of a user name and password, separated by a colon, followed by an at symbol (@)
			<li>A "host", consisting of either a registered name (including but not limited to a hostname), or an IP address. IPv4 addresses must be in dot-decimal notation, and IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]).
			<li>An optional port number, separated from the hostname by a colon
		</ul>
	<li>A path, which contains data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that appears as a sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash. The final part of the path may be referred to as a 'slug'.
	<li>Semicolon (;)[d][incomplete short citation]	key1=value1;key2=value2
	<li>An optional query, separated from the preceding part by a question mark (?), containing a query string of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by a delimiter.
	<li>An optional fragment, separated from the preceding part by a hash (#). The fragment contains a fragment identifier providing direction to a secondary resource, such as a section heading in an article identified by the remainder of the URI. When the primary resource is an HTML document, the fragment is often an id attribute of a specific element, and web browsers will scroll this element into view.
	<li>A web browser will usually dereference a URL by performing an HTTP request to the specified host, by default on port number 80. URLs using the https scheme require that requests and responses will be made over a secure connection to the website.
</ul>
