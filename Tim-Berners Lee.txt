In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN (European Organization of Nuclear Research), invented the World Wide Web or simply the Web. The web was originally conceived for automatic information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.

The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer. The website described the features of the Web; how to access other people’s documents and how to set up your own server.

The NeXt machine is the original web server.

On 30 April 1993, CERN put the Web software in the public domain. CERN made the next release available with an open license, as a more sure way to maximize its dissemination.

The line-mode browser was launched in 1992, and was the first readily accessible browser for the Web

The three cornerstone of the web: HTTP, HTML, URI
